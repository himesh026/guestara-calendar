##  Learnings & Challenges

üß† 3 Things Learned
Advanced React State Management ‚Äì Handling complex UI interactions with drag, drop, and resizing.
Event Persistence ‚Äì Implementing local storage to retain events after refresh.
Dynamic Grid Handling ‚Äì Creating a scrollable, responsive 2D grid for scheduling.
